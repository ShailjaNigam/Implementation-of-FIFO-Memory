Low Pass FIR filter implementation

Title: Low Pass FIR filter implementation

Objective:
A simple low pass FIR filter implementation which is for ECG Denoising and other applications. 
We give the data values as the input and it applies digital filtering then gives the filtered outputs.

RTL or software application: RTL

Functionality:
The FIR filter is basically implemented by using D-Flip-Flops, signed multipliers and adders.
A basic block includes one N-bit register, one multiplier, and one adder. 
Full design can be done by repeating the basic blocks.
The filter we are going to implement is of the order 10 and the taps used are 11. 
(Taps mean The number of taps (N) is the amount of the memory needed to implement the filter).
We use certain coefficient values and multiply to the output of the D - flip flop which are in series. 
Finally add them to get the output
