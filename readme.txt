Verilog code implementation of FIFO Memory

Following is the brief of our code and functions performed by modules.

This code contains 5 modules. Below points explain inputs and functions by each module.
=> Module 1: This module just calls the modules in the below written order (2,3,4,5). module definition is,

  module fifo_mem(data_out,fifo_full, fifo_empty, fifo_threshold, fifo_overflow, fifo_underflow,clk, rst_n, wr, rd, data_in);  

  inputs and their significance:
  wr : if it is '1' then data_in is written into memory.
  rd : if it is '1' then output will be given according to fifo.
  clk : clock with some time period.
  rst_n : if it is '0' then everything is cleared from memory.
  data_in : input data. it is of 8 bits.

  outputs and their significance:
  data_out : 8 bits output. It updates when rd is '1'.
  fifo_empty : it is '1' if memory is empty.
  fifo_full : it is '1' if memory is full.
  fifo_threshold : it is '1' when the number of data in FIFO is less than a specific threshold, else low.
  fifo_overflow : it is '1' when fifo_full is one and we still writing something in to memory.
  fifo_underflow : it is '1' when fifo_empty is one and we still reading something from memory.

=> Module 2 : This module shows where the data just given as input stored. The module definition is,

  module write_pointer(wptr,fifo_we,wr,fifo_full,clk,rst_n);

  inputs and their significance:
  wr,fifo_full,clk,rst_n has their usual meanings as mentioned in module 1.

  outputs and their significance:
  fifo_we : output is '1' if wr is one and fifo_full is zero. can be understood as write enable.
  wptr : It is a 5 bit number increments by 1 when fifo_we is 1. starts from 0 when rst_n is 0.
         It changes at positive edge of clock or negitive edge of rst_n.

=> Module 3 : This module shows from where the data is just read. The module definition is,

  module readpointer(rptr,fifo_rd,rd,fifo_empty,clk,rst_n);
  
  inputs and their significance:
  rd,fifo_empty,clk,rst_n has their usual meanings.

  outputs and their significance:
  fifo_rd : output is '1' if rd is one and fempty is zero. can be understood as read enable.
  rptr : It is a 5 bit number increments by 1 when frd is 1. starts from 0 when rst_n is 0.
         It changes at positive edge of clock or negitive edge of rst_n.

=> Module 4 : This module performs assigning the data_in to memory and giving data_out as output based on 
              wptr and rptr respectively. The module definition is,

  module memory_array(data_out,data_in,clk,fifo_we,wptr,rptr);

  inputs and their significance:
  data_in,clk,fwe,wptr,rptr has their usual meanings.
  
  output and their significance:
  we output data_out based on rptr pointer.

  other than output and input we store the data_in at every positive edge of clock and when fifo_we is 1.

=> Module 5 : This module updates the values of fifo_full, fifo_empty, fifo_threshold, fifo_overflow, fifo_underflow for every
              change in input. The module is defined as,

  module status_signal(fifo_full,fifo_empty,fifo_threshold,fifo_overflow,fifo_underflow,wr,rd,fifo_we,fifo_rd,wptr,rptr,clk,rst_n);

  inputs and their significance:
  wr,rd,fifo_we,fifo_rd,wptr,rptr,clk,rst_n are inputs and has usual meanings.

  output and their significance:
  fifo_full,fifo_empty,fifo_threshold,fifo_overflow,fifo_underflow are outputs and has usual meanings as mentioned in module 1.
